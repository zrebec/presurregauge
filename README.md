# Pressure Gauge Application

## Introduction

Monitoring blood pressure is a critical aspect of maintaining overall health and well-being. High blood pressure (hypertension) is a significant risk factor for heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and other serious health conditions. Regular blood pressure monitoring allows individuals and healthcare providers to track trends, identify potential problems early, and make informed decisions about lifestyle changes or medical interventions. This application, the Pressure Gauge, is designed to simplify the process of recording and tracking your blood pressure readings.
